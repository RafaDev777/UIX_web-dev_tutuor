			There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
			majority have suffered alteration in some form,
			<a href="https://google.com/search?q=humour" target="_blank"
				>by injected humour</a
			>, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you
			are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
			anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
			generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
			making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
			of over <strong>200 Latin words</strong>, combined with a handful of model
			sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
			generated <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> is therefore always free from
			repetition, <em>injected humour</em>, or non-characteristic words etc.

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
			roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
			2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
			College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
			consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
			the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
			Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
			Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
			book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
			Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
			amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem
			Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.<br /><br />
			Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
			Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
			English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
